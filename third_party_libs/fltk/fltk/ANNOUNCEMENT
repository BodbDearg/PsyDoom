Note to Git users: This branch (branch-1.3) is end of life since the
release of FLTK 1.3.4. Only very serious bug fixes will be available
if FLTK 1.4.0 is not yet released or not (yet) stable enough.

The current development branch is 'master' -- please checkout a new,
clean working copy if you want to get FLTK 1.4 (master).
