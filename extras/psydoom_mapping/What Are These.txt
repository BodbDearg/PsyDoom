DOOMSND.WMD
---------------------------------------
This is an updated Williams Module file (WMD) that can be redistributed with new PsyDoom maps. It contains MIDI data and instrument definitions for all original Doom & Final Doom sound and music. In addition to this it also contains data for re-implemented PC Doom II enemies such as the Arch-vile. Note that the module file does not contain any actual audio samples, that data is found in .LCD files.

---------------------------------------
ALLMAPS.LCD
---------------------------------------
This is an audio bank that contains ADPCM encoded sounds for all possible enemies in the game, including enemies re-implemented from PC Doom II such as the Arch-vile. If PsyDoom detects this file in a user map directory then it will load this LCD file for all maps instead of the usual 'MAP01.LCD', 'MAP02.LCD' etc. files. The purpose of this LCD is to eliminate the requirement to build individual LCD files for user maps, based on what enemies appear; thus, this file help can simplify modding. Since PsyDoom has greatly expanded sound RAM it can afford to just load all possible enemy sounds instead of using per-level banks that have been trimmed down to just the enemies that appear.

CREDITS: The GEC team behind the "PlayStation Doom: Master Edition" project has kindly donated the new sounds for the reimplemented Doom II enemies. If using this audio bank you should give credit to Team GEC in your README.
