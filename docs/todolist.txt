0.7 - GPU & Rendering?
- Vk renderer: get working on MacOS
- Vk renderer: device selection: add code to ensure all formats used are supported
- Vk renderer: fix UI sprite stitching.
- Vk renderer: add support for large allocs and maybe force framebuffers to be allocated outside of memory mgr
- Vk renderer: add option to disable widescreen
- Vk renderer: add option to disable Vulkan completely (to save RAM)
- Vk renderer: save renderer preference and provide menu option
- Vk renderer: add render scale option
- Vk renderer: revisit vertex welding to fix some artifacts in Final Doom levels?
- Classic renderer: allow wall heights > 256 units; make adjustments to the renderer to split up overly tall wall columns.
- Classic renderer: implement sky wall drawing to fix some adjacent (higher) ceilings and walls not being occluded
- Classic renderer: add a new textured row/column GPU primitive to accelerate world drawing
- Fix renderer switch sometimes not happening in menus
- Maybe get rid of use of the 'scratchpad' and use globals or locals (where possible) for LIBGPU primitives.
- Investigate view bobbing run vs walk.
- Add a level end timer for speedrunning?
- Add fast-load (skip waiting for sound to stop playing) for speedrunning?
- Investigate game end pause issue (unable to unpause)
    - May need to prioritize continue vs pause if conflicting key bindings
- Investigate default key bindings - Q & E for example.
    - Maybe remove a few, might be be more confusing to have too many bindings.
- Investigate Final Doom music pitch issue mentioned on Doomworld.
- Use interpolation for map view.
- -pistolstart command line switch

0.8 - Limit extending and modding?
- Add map patching mechanism for a few select map bugs
    - Fix house of pain door bug
    - Fix Ballystix altar not being see through with new vk renderer (need to mark as 'void' ceiling)
- Classic renderer: add support for 'void' ceiling type that the new VK renderer is starting to formalize.
    - Any ceiling pic < -1 should be considered a 'void' (render nothing) ceiling.
- Investigate a MAPINFO format for naming maps, choosing music etc.
- Investigate engine limits and try to remove/expand where possible
    - No texture cache overflow
    - Expanded VRAM
    - Expanded SRAM
    - More audio voices (will help sounds occasionally not playing)
    - Greatly enlargened heap
    - Remove temporary buffer limits
    - Remove geometry clipping limits where possible
- Investigate being able to add override/new lumps via map wads.
- Investigate being able to add override/new lumps via custom user wads.
- New extended floating point SPU module with better sound quality?
    - Will help clipping issues.

0.9 - Networking, saves and interpolation?
- Investigate rollback networking to combat latency.
    - Could also be used for a rewind feature??!
    - Could also be used for a save feature.
- Interpolate player weapon sway
- Investigate interpolation for sprites and sectors in addition to player view.

1.0 - Final polish?
- Linux support.
- Implement playing the intro movies and legal text
- Add demo recording support and a new demo format that supports 30 FPS recording and analog movement.
    - Still support old format for playback, add signature to demo start to identify.
- Do a final review/diff against PSXDOOM-RE to double check for any inconsistencies.
- Add ability to input passwords with keyboard
- Writeup final readmes and docs.
- Makeup final logo
