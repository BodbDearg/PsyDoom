0.8 Bugs & investigation:
- E2M3's track sounds off-sync in length.
    - The track should be 1:19 minutes in length before looping - for some reason it's a few seconds longer which causes the sync issue.
- Sector Action 11 shouldn't let you die.
    - Sector Action 11: 10% to 20% Damage (ends level) kills you
- Doomguy can't climb steep stairs normally unless they run at an angle.
    - Found when converting the PC Doom 1 maps, E3M4 has a steep staircase at the end of the level.
