0.8 Bugs & investigation:
- Fix tall pillars being clipped away in classic renderer up close.
- E2M3's track sounds off-sync in length.
    - The track should be 1:19 minutes in length before looping - for some reason it's a few seconds longer which causes the sync issue.
- Sector Action 4 doesn't strobe lights fast.
    - Sector Action 4: 10% to 20% Damage (Lights Blink at 0.5 sec) is missing fast strobing lights
- Sector Action 11 shouldn't let you die.
    - Sector Action 11: 10% to 20% Damage (ends level) kills you
- Linedef action 37 - W1 Floor Lower to Lowest Floor (changes texture) still doesn't work properly.
    - It only happens if you have multiple sectors joined together with it like in PC Doom's e3m1's collapsing bridge.
    - Linedef Action 37: W1 Floor Lower to Lowest Floor (changes texture) doesn't work on multiple joined sectors
- Doomguy can't climb steep stairs normally unless they run at an angle.
    - Found when converting the PC Doom 1 maps, E3M4 has a steep staircase at the end of the level.
